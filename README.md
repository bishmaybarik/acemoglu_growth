This repository contains the STATA and Python codes to recreate the graphs made by Daron Acemoglu in Chapter 1 of his famous book 'Introduction to Modern Economic Growth'. This repository has been created only for teaching purpose, for ECO512: Macroeconomics II at Shiv Nadar University, India. 

The repository structure is given below:

The data how been downloaded from [Penn World Table](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en). The latest data available can be available in [PWT 10.01](https://dataverse.nl/api/access/datafile/354098). 

The data is also available in the `01_data` folder of my repository, in both .csv and .dta format. I would highly suggest you to have a look at the data and it's variables, for further clarity about what the dataset entails. 

The results and the latest graphs can be found in the `01_graphs` folder. 

This is a testing line.
